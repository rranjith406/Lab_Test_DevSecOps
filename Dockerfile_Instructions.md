Once you've customized the Dockerfile, you can build a new Docker image based on your changes:

**docker build -t your_image_name:tag .**

With the updated Docker image, you can run containers using the image:
Replace your_image_name with the desired name for your image and tag with a version or tag for the image.
The . at the end of the command refers to the current directory, where the Dockerfile is located.

**docker run -d -p 8080:8080 your_image_name:tag**

This will run your application inside a container, 
and you can access it from your host machine at http://localhost:8080 (assuming your application listens on port 8080).
